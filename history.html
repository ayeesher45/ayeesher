            <h1>Origin and Development of Aliero</h1>
            <p>
            The original founders of Aliero were Namasawa and Kabawa tribes in the late 16 century. In the 17h century people from different ethnic groups like Bare-bare from Barno, Marina from Nupeland, Zamfarawa from Zam fara and Wangarawa from Mali migrated and inhabited the area as a result of the fertile nature of the land.
            The place known as Aliero had got its name from a Fulani Herdsman ALI DAN YARO who had been coming to the area annually to graze his animals from nearby Zauro/Ambursa Area and settled in the area temporarily. The name Aliero came as a
            result of Dan Yaro's relatives who also come from Zauro/Ambursa Area who referred to intent of visiting Ali Dan Yaro as we are going to visit "Ali Dan Yaro" which later turned to Ali Yaro. It was during the colonial time that ALI YARO was
            metamorphosed to ALIERO by the British administrators.
            As the place gradually increase in population due to immigration, there was well known Muslim scholar named Almustapha Hamma who was a Wangara man that came from Mali to Maratta ( now Niger Republic ) and stayed there for many years before moving to Gobir , Karangiya and Jakurutu in Argungu and later he finally came back and settle in Aliero . He was warmly welcomed and was received by the people in the area . He wrote and informed Malam Abdullahi bn Fodio of his coming to the Area. As a learned scholar , it was through his preaching and practice that he converted many people to Islam. As a result of this , the people of the area thought of compensating him with the leadership of Aliero town.
            Many group of people are found in the area today . The first group are Kabawa who arrived to the area at the end of 17th century . They were from the former Kabi Kingdom under the leadership of Lumu . They settled in the area for the purpose of farming . They are found in north - west of the area where they formed a clan.
            The second group settled in the area are Dakkarawa tribes . They arrived to the area in the early 18th century under the leadership of Kamso. They later left the town and settled in a village called Kali, 2km away from the western part of Aliero town.
            Zamfarawa is another group of people who settled in the area and formed their clan. A group of Wangarawa later Namasawa who visited Hausaland from Mali for the spread of Islam moved to the area. This formed the historical evolution of the area. On the above account, we could understand that, the area
             witnessed a rapid development since precolonial era.
